# High Level Programming Languages Lab

Exercises can be found [here](https://github.com/INBPA0212L-2023/exercises).

Each Week contains a quick overview of what we have discussed.

## Homeworks

### Submission

You can use the following [form](https://forms.gle/vtMBJi1QwpN2NgFp8) to submit your codes. Deadline is always **Wednesday at 11:59 PM** for each week. Please submit these homeworks on a weekly basis. I will review your codes and give points and feedback based on that. Also note that its optional to submit the homeworks, however you cannot depend 100% on class and this can be used for practice that I would give feedback on.
